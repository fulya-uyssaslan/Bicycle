First Deep Learning Project

This repository contains my first deep learning project, which I completed by following BTK Akademiâ€™s video tutorials. The project was an important step for me, as I initially found deep learning concepts challenging.

Project Details:
The dataset used in this project was generated from synthetic data. It includes the price of a bicycle and two of its features. A total of 1,000 records were created, split into 670 for training and 330 for testing. In the end, the model achieved a good prediction performance.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Using essential Python libraries and commands for deep learning

Splitting and preprocessing data for training and testing

Structuring data across multiple layers

Configuring neurons and defining their connections

Applying activation functions and adjusting data accordingly

Training, evaluating, and optimizing model performance

Preventing overfitting and troubleshooting errors

Visualizing results and interpreting model outputs

This project was developed in Visual Studio Code using Jupyter Notebooks and demonstrates my foundational understanding of neural networks and practical implementation skills in deep learning.
