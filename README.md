First Deep Learning Project : My first deep learning project, completed following BTK Akademi tutorials. I learned how to preprocess data, structure neural networks, apply activation functions, train and evaluate models, and troubleshoot errors.
First Deep Learning Project

This repository contains my first deep learning project, which I completed by following BTK Akademiâ€™s video tutorials. The project was an important step for me, as I initially found deep learning concepts challenging.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Using essential Python libraries and commands for deep learning

Splitting and preprocessing data for training and testing

Structuring data across multiple layers

Configuring neurons and defining their connections

Applying activation functions and adjusting data accordingly

Training, evaluating, and optimizing model performance

Preventing overfitting and troubleshooting errors

Visualizing results and interpreting model outputs

This project demonstrates my foundational understanding of neural networks and practical implementation skills in deep learning.
